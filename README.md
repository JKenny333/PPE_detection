PPE Detection Project

Objective
  Develop a machine learning model capable of accurately detecting the presence of specific PPE items (hard hats, high-visibility vests, and face masks) on construction workers in realtime 
  through video or image analysis. The project aims to enhance workplace safety by ensuring compliance with safety gear regulations.
